### Hi there 👋

Hi! I’m an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. I am currently employed as a Research Assistant in CFDA & CLIP Labs, Research Center of Information Technology Center, Academia Sinica.

My research interests focus on Data Science. In particular, I aim to optimize the performance of Recommendation System. I'm interested in developing embedded system as well.

BTW Garlic is my cute dog 🐶
