### Hi there 👋

I’m an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. I am currently employed at Academia Sinica as a Research Assistant. I also held numerous events when I was a freshman at university.

I am familiar with developing, including C++ and Python. I am also experienced in firmware development on ARM-based Architecture.

BTW Garlic is my cute dog🐶
